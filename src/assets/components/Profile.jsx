            Graduate in <strong>Mathematical Logic</strong> and <strong>Philosophy</strong>. 
            My academic background in formal and abstract topics and the intensive <strong> problem-solving</strong> training translates naturally into <strong>coding</strong> â€” 
            I approach technical challenges both systematically and <strong>creatively</strong>.
            Through intensive bootcamp, self-teaching and challenging projects, 
            I'm building a solid foundation in <strong>full-stack development</strong>. 
            I'm seeking junior developer positions where I can contribute fresh perspectives, <strong>learn actively</strong>, and grow alongside experienced teams.
